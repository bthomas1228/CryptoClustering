# CryptoClustering

Please refer to the linked repo to find the directory "Crypto_Clustering" and the completed homework. To review the python script, please open 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb' in Jupyter notebook. 

Xpert Learning Assistant and online coding sources were used (e.g. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) to provied guidance on scripting the code needed for this module. A review of the Activities was also very helpful and used heavily.

sklearn, pandas and hvplat were used to make a KMeans model from scaled data. Clusters were optimized using Principal Component Analysis. Plots were compared to determine if fewer or more features may be better.
